## Face Recognition Attendance Management System

## Abstract
The participation of students in a huge class is difficult to handle by the normal system using nowadays , because it both creates a waste of time and there is a chance that various errors may occur at the stage of entering the system. It is also advantageous because it provides both convenience and security. We can say that biometric methods for face recognition are the fastest and least erroneous security verification. In this project, a face recognition system and an automatic attendance system system have been proposed. Automatic identification and verification of people in the digital environment is provided in the system. The face is first taken from the camera, and its coordinates are recorded in the database. Then, the data in the database is taught to the system by using the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm. The Python programming language will be used in the project and the OpenCV library is intended to be used.
In this system, some features are intended that should be completed. First of all, it is necessary to ensure automatic and real-time participation in our project, and the system in which facial features are recognized must have high accuracy.
